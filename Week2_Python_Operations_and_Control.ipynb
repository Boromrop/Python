    "|----------|------|---------|--------|\n",
    "| `+` | Addition | `5 + 3` | `8` |\n",
    "| `-` | Subtraction | `10 - 4` | `6` |\n",
    "| `*` | Multiplication | `6 * 7` | `42` |\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Regular Division (`/`):\n",
    "- **Always returns a float** (decimal number)\n",
    "- `10 / 2` = `5.0` (not `5`)\n",
    "- Works exactly like your calculator\n",

    "#### Floor Division (`//`):  \n",
    "- **Returns only the whole number part**\n",
    "- `17 // 3` = `5` (throws away the remainder)\n",
    "- Like dividing and rounding down\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modulus (`%`):\n",
    "- **Returns only the remainder**\n",
    "- `17 % 3` = `2` (because 17 ÷ 3 = 5 remainder 2)\n",
    "- Super useful for checking if numbers are even/odd\n",

    "### Order of Operations (PEMDAS):\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in math class, Python follows the order of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **P**arentheses `()`\n",
    "2. **E**xponents `**`  \n",

    "4. **A**ddition `+` and **S**ubtraction `-`\n",

    "## 2. Comparison Operators - Making Your Program Think 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Comparison Operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators let you **compare values** and get True or False answers. They're like asking questions: \"Is this bigger than that?\" or \"Are these equal?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Six Comparison Operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Name | Question It Asks | Example | Result |\n",
    "|----------|------|------------------|---------|--------|\n",
    "| `==` | Equal to | \"Are they the same?\" | `5 == 5` | `True` |\n",
    "| `!=` | Not equal to | \"Are they different?\" | `5 != 3` | `True` |\n",
    "| `>` | Greater than | \"Is left bigger?\" | `8 > 3` | `True` |\n",
    "| `<` | Less than | \"Is left smaller?\" | `2 < 7` | `True` |\n",
    "| `>=` | Greater than or equal | \"Is left bigger or same?\" | `5 >= 5` | `True` |\n",
    "| `<=` | Less than or equal | \"Is left smaller or same?\" | `3 <= 7` | `True` |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚨 Common Beginner Mistake:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assignment**: `x = 5` (stores 5 in variable x)\n",
    "- **Comparison**: `x == 5` (asks \"is x equal to 5?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't confuse `=` (assignment) with `==` (comparison)!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Different Data Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numbers:\n",
    "- `10 > 5` → `True`\n",
    "- `3.14 == 3.14` → `True`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings:\n",
    "- `\"apple\" == \"apple\"` → `True`\n",
    "- `\"Apple\" == \"apple\"` → `False` (case matters!)\n",
    "- `\"a\" < \"b\"` → `True` (alphabetical order)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mixed Types:\n",
    "- `5 == \"5\"` → `False` (number vs string)\n",
    "- Always compare same types for best results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Comparisons Matter:\n",
    "\n",
    "Every smart program needs to make decisions:\n",
    "- **Login systems**: \"Is the password correct?\"\n",
    "- **Games**: \"Did the player win?\"\n",
    "- **Shopping**: \"Is there enough money?\"\n",

    "## 4. Input and Output - Making Programs Interactive 💬\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Input and Output?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input** and **Output** (I/O) are how your program **communicates** with users:\n",
    "- **Input**: Getting information FROM the user\n",
    "- **Output**: Displaying information TO the user\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what makes programs **interactive** instead of just running the same way every time!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Two Essential Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `input()` - Getting Information FROM Users 📥\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_response = input(\"What's your name? \")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Always returns a string** (even if user types numbers!)\n",
    "- Pauses program until user presses Enter\n",
    "- The text in parentheses is the \"prompt\" shown to user\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `print()` - Displaying Information TO Users 📤  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "print(\"Your age is:\", age)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Shows information on the screen\n",
    "- Can display multiple values separated by commas\n",
    "- Automatically adds a new line at the end\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Input Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Everything is a string**: `input()` always returns text\n",
    "2. **Convert when needed**: Use `int()` or `float()` for numbers\n",
    "3. **Handle errors**: Users might type unexpected things\n",
    "4. **Be clear**: Give good prompts so users know what to enter\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Input Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Getting text\n",
    "name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting integers\n",
    "age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting floats\n",
    "height = float(input(\"Enter your height: \"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting yes/no answers\n",
    "answer = input(\"Do you agree? (yes/no): \").lower()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why I/O is Crucial:\n",
    "\n",
    "Every useful program needs I/O:\n",
    "- **Games**: Get player moves, show game state\n",
    "- **Calculators**: Get numbers, show results  \n",
    "- **Apps**: Get user preferences, display information\n",
    "- **Websites**: Get form data, show responses"

    "## 5. Conditional Statements - Making Programs Smart 🧠\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Conditional Statements?\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements let your programs **make decisions** based on different situations. They're like giving your program a brain that can choose what to do!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three Types of Conditional Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. `if` Statement - \"If this is true, do something\"\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Code that runs when condition is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `if-else` Statement - \"If this, otherwise that\"\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Code when condition is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code when condition is False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `if-elif-else` Statement - \"Multiple choices\"\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # Code when condition1 is True\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # Code when condition2 is True\n",
    "elif condition3:\n",
    "    # Code when condition3 is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code when none of the conditions are True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚨 Critical Python Rule: Indentation Matters!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses **indentation** (spaces) to group code together:\n",
    "- **4 spaces** is the standard indentation\n",
    "- All code at the same level must have the same indentation\n",
    "- Wrong indentation = Error!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Correct indentation:\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You can vote!\")\n",
    "    print(\"You are an adult!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wrong indentation - This will cause an error!\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "print(\"You can vote!\")  # ERROR: Not indented!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Decision Making:\n",
    "\n",
    "Every smart system uses conditional logic:\n",
    "- **ATM**: If PIN is correct, allow access\n",
    "- **Netflix**: If user has subscription, show content  \n",
    "- **Games**: If player reaches goal, they win\n",
    "- **Weather App**: If temperature < 32°F, show \"Freezing!\"\n",
    "- **E-commerce**: If cart total > $50, free shipping\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building Complex Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine conditions with logical operators:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if age >= 18 and has_license and not is_suspended:\n",
    "    print(\"You can drive!\")\n",
    "```"

    "Without loops, you'd have to write the same code hundreds of times! 😱\n",

    "\n",
    "| Loop Type | When to Use | Best For |\n",

    "| **for loop** | When you know how many times to repeat OR when processing sequences | Lists, ranges, counting, iterating |\n",
