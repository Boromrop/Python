    "### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **high-level programming language** created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Think of it as a way to communicate with your computer using words and commands that are closer to human language than other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python is Perfect for Beginners:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Readable Syntax**: Python code reads almost like English sentences\n",
    "2. **Less Typing**: You can accomplish more with fewer lines of code\n",
    "3. **Forgiving**: Python helps catch many common mistakes automatically\n",
    "4. **Interactive**: You can test small pieces of code immediately\n",
    "5. **Extensive Libraries**: Thousands of pre-built tools for different tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Python Works - A Simple Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write Python code:\n",
    "1. **You write** instructions in Python language\n",
    "2. **Python interpreter reads** your instructions\n",
    "3. **Computer executes** the instructions\n",
    "4. **You see the results** on your screen\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Python as a translator between you and your computer!\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Variables - Your First Programming Concept üì¶\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a **variable** as a **labeled box** where you can store information. Just like you might have boxes in your room labeled \"Books\", \"Clothes\", or \"Toys\", variables in Python have names and hold different types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine trying to do math without being able to write down numbers, or writing a story without being able to remember character names! Variables let us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Store information** for later use\n",
    "- **Give meaningful names** to our data  \n",
    "- **Reuse values** throughout our program\n",
    "- **Make our code easier to understand**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Naming Rules in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Good Variable Names:**\n",
    "- `name` (descriptive)\n",
    "- `student_age` (uses underscore for multiple words)\n",
    "- `total_score` (clear meaning)\n",
    "- `is_valid` (describes what it represents)\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùå **Invalid Variable Names:**\n",
    "- `2name` (can't start with number)\n",
    "- `my-name` (can't use hyphens)\n",
    "- `class` (can't use Python keywords)\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Use lowercase letters\n",
    "- Separate words with underscores (`snake_case`)\n",
    "- Make names descriptive\n",
    "- Avoid single letters (except for simple counters like `i`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Your First Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, creating a variable is as simple as typing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "variable_name = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `=` sign doesn't mean \"equals\" like in math - it means \"assign the value on the right to the variable on the left\"."

    "#### 1. **Integers (int)** üî¢\n",
    "- **What**: Whole numbers (no decimal points)\n",
    "- **Examples**: `5`, `-3`, `0`, `1000`\n",
    "- **Used for**: Counting, ages, scores, quantities\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Floats (float)** üî¢.üî¢  \n",
    "- **What**: Numbers with decimal points\n",
    "- **Examples**: `3.14`, `-2.5`, `0.0`, `99.99`\n",
    "- **Used for**: Measurements, prices, percentages, scientific calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Strings (str)** üìù\n",
    "- **What**: Text, words, sentences  \n",
    "- **Examples**: `\"Hello\"`, `'Python'`, `\"123 Main St\"`\n",
    "- **Used for**: Names, addresses, messages, any text data\n",
    "- **Important**: Always surrounded by quotes (single or double)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Booleans (bool)** ‚úÖ‚ùå\n",
    "- **What**: True or False values only\n",
    "- **Examples**: `True`, `False` \n",
    "- **Used for**: Yes/No questions, on/off switches, validation\n",

    "### How Python Determines Data Types:\n",

    "## 5. Working with Strings - Mastering Text in Python üìù\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Strings?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strings** are Python's way of handling text. The name \"string\" comes from the idea of \"stringing together\" characters like beads on a necklace: H-e-l-l-o.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Strings - Three Ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Single Quotes** `'text'`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message = 'Hello, Python!'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Double Quotes** `\"text\"`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message = \"Hello, Python!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Triple Quotes** `\"\"\"text\"\"\"` (for multiple lines)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "story = \"\"\"Once upon a time,\n",
    "there was a programmer\n",
    "who loved Python.\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Which Quotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single quotes**: Most common for simple text\n",
    "- **Double quotes**: When your text contains single quotes (like contractions)\n",
    "- **Triple quotes**: For long text spanning multiple lines\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immutable**: Once created, strings cannot be changed (but you can create new ones)\n",
    "2. **Indexed**: Each character has a position number (starting from 0)\n",
    "3. **Sequence**: You can loop through each character\n",
    "4. **Case-sensitive**: `\"Hello\"` and `\"hello\"` are different strings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Strings are So Important:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Interface**: All text displayed to users\n",
    "- **Data Processing**: Names, addresses, descriptions  \n",
    "- **Communication**: Messages, emails, notifications\n",
    "- **File Operations**: Filenames, file content\n",
    "- **Web Development**: HTML, URLs, form data"
